Data Analysis for my Bachelor Thesis "Dynamical changes of polyethylene imine in porous silica upon CO_2 sorption"

## General Info
- Use the PEI20 file as example file to apply to new data.
  Use the PEI43 file only to reproduce data analysis of the respective data set. It needs some specific changes in the raw data import.
- needed libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, cycler
- code was run on python version 3.10.12

### Files
- results20.zip all plots for PEI-20 as **vector graphs**. If plots are desired to be used, this is the best place.
- ...all_results.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the calculations and plots (apart from relaxation times) used in result section of my thesis
- ...relaxationtimes.ipynb: plots of tau vs temperature from different methods
- ...interpl-showcase.ipynb: plots of the difference between interpolation and raw data
- ...overview.ipynb: plots an overview of the raw data on hand. Evolution of the spectrum over time
- raw data ...: raw measurement data
